The [nushell script](https://www.nushell.sh/) called [lovemii.sh](./lovemii.sh) is a helper for the desktop, it will list all software and little disclaimers for what I use them in this system of applications.

Note folders of the unix architecture here, they reference their respective counterparts.

See [this repository called _starberry_](https://github.com/BeyondMagic/starberry) for linux tools I use along this desktop.
